ddfingerd is designed to run chroot()ed under a nonroot uid. It reads
all its data from a cdb which will be created by dffingerd-conf.  It
does its interfacing to the network via tcpserver/ucspi-tcp and is logs
to stderr. dffingerd is designed to run supervised by daemontools and
feed its output to multilog, but can be used even with plain inetd.

I have tried to build as much paranoia in it as possible. Running
chrooted dffingerd has only the ability to read its data from a single
file, data.cdb.

By using a cdb dffingerd scales very well. It can handle tens of
thousands different users without degenerating preformance.

dffingerd-data creates the cdb for dffingerd by reading files from a
specific directory. You can copy your users .plan files there or
chreate files for publishing other information. To make information
available under bizarreuser@hostname you don't have to create an user
bizarreuser on your machine; yust stuff the information you want to
serve in a file called bizarreuser.

dffingerd-conf sets up dffingerd for use with daemontools.
