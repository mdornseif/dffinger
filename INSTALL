Quick'd dirty:

You need tcpserver and daemontools

To bulid:

Get dnscache from http://cr.yp.to/, extract it, compile it.
Copy all files form the dnscache directory to djb/
# make
create two users: finger and fingerl
# /usr/local/bin/dffingerd-conf finger fingerl /etc/dffingerd 127.0.0.1
# ln -s /etc/dffingerd /service/
# cd /etc/dffingerd/root
# echo "test user 1" > data/test1
# echo "test user 2" > data/test2
# make
# finger test1@localhost
# finger test2@localhost
# finger unknown@localhost


INSTALLING

Get dnscache from http://cr.yp.to/, extract it, compile it.
Copy all files form the dnscache directory to djb/

Compile and install dffingerd:

  	# make install

This will create dffingerd, dffingerd-conf and dffingerd-data in
/usr/local/bin.

Now create two users one for running dffingerd and one for logging. I
will use "finger" and "fingerl".

Decide where to put dffingerds data. I will use "/etc/dffningerd". Then
run dffigerd-conf:

	# dffingerd-conf finger fingerl /etc/dffingerd 0.0.0.0

You can replace 0.0.0.0 by the IP adress dffingerd should bind to.
0.0.0.0 will bind dffingerd to all your IP adresses

Go to "/etc/dffingerd/root" and create some test data. The data for
dffingerd is in the subdirectory "data", every file in this
subdirectory refers to the data returned for the username represented
by the filename. So

	# echo "Joe Cypherpunk" > data/joe
	# echo "test user 1" > data/test1
	# echo "test user 2" > data/test2
	# cat "/etc/resolv.conf" > data/resolv

will generate data for the users "joe", "test1", "test2" and "resolv"
Now enter make to build the cdb. The cdb will be build atomically so
there will be no disruption of service while rebuilding it. If there
are some errors the original database stays untouched.

Now you can start dffingerd by telling svscan about it:

	# ln -s /etc/dffingerd /service

Test it:

	# finger joe@localhost
	# finger test1@localhost
	# finger test2@localhost
	# finger unknown@localhost


The username "default" is special. If dffingerd can't find a requested
username it will try the user "default" instead.

Have a look on the Logfile:

        # tail /etc/dffingerd/log/main/current

If you want to move users .plan files to the dffingerd cdb you
might ask robotnik@koeln.ccc.de for his dffingerd-feed - see
