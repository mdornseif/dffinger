This is dffinger, it was long time ago a patch to Fefes Finger Daemon
ffingerd.  Since ffingerd didn't met my level of paranoia, I decided
to rewrite it using technices learnd from the tools of Dan Bernstein.
I used Bernsteins Librarys because they seemed to be much better
engineered than the standard libc. Since Dan hasn't settled his
Library setup up to now and doesn't provide his Library for download,
I had to rip it out of one of his tools. To compile you have to
provide a configured copy of dnscache in the subdir "djb". The
Makefile tries to do this for you but better do it yourself.

ddfingerd is designed to run chroot()ed under a nonroot uid. It reads
all its data from a cdb which will be created by dffingerd-conf.  It
does its interfacing to the network via tcpserver/ucspi-tcp and is logs
to stderr. dffingerd is designed to run supervised by daemontools and
feed its output to multilog. 

If you want to run dffingerd with inetd tcp-env from qmail might come 
handy. See http://www.qmail.org/qmail-manual-html/man1/tcp-env.html
